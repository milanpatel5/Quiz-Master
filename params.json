The controller with which buzzer is connected, communicates with this application through UART. Normally the controller keeps sending '0'. It sends '1', '2'.. as per team which presses buzzer first.\r\nThe values transmitted through UART can be read by Python using \"pyserial\" library and these values processed by Python are written on \"Portvalues.txt\" file.\r\nThere is a \"teams.txt\" file in project folder which contains team names. The first line of this file is a greeting message that you want to show normally. i.e \"Ready?\". \r\n    \r\n    \r\nTimer: \r\n  This part has a text box in which you can write time(in seconds). Pressing \"Enter key\" will start count down and at the end it will show \"Times Up!\" message.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
